Given an array A of integers, return the number of (contiguous, non-empty) subarrays that have a sum divisible by K.

 

Example 1:

Input: A = [4,5,0,-2,-3,1], K = 5
Output: 7
Explanation: There are 7 subarrays with a sum divisible by K = 5:
[4, 5, 0, -2, -3, 1], [5], [5, 0], [5, 0, -2, -3], [0], [0, -2, -3], [-2, -3]
 

Note:

1 <= A.length <= 30000
-10000 <= A[i] <= 10000
2 <= K <= 10000
