A uni-value subtree means all nodes of the subtree have the same value.

Input: root = [5,1,5,5,5,null,5]
Output: 4
Example 2:

Input: root = []
Output: 0
Example 3:

Input: root = [5,5,5,5,5,null,5]
Output: 6
 

Constraints:

The numbrt of the node in the tree will be in the range [0, 1000].
-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000
