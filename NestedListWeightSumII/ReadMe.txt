You are given a nested list of integers nestedList. Each element is either an integer or a list whose elements may also be integers or other lists.

The depth of an integer is the number of lists that it is inside of. For example, the nested list [1,[2,2],[[3],2],1] has each integer's value set to its depth. Let maxDepth be the maximum depth of any integer.

The weight of an integer is maxDepth - (the depth of the integer) + 1.

Return the sum of each integer in nestedList multiplied by its weight.

 

Example 1:


Input: nestedList = [[1,1],2,[1,1]]
Output: 8
Explanation: Four 1's with a weight of 1, one 2 with a weight of 2.
1*1 + 1*1 + 2*2 + 1*1 + 1*1 = 8
Example 2:


Input: nestedList = [1,[4,[6]]]
Output: 17
Explanation: One 1 at depth 3, one 4 at depth 2, and one 6 at depth 1.
1*3 + 4*2 + 6*1 = 17
 

Constraints:

1 <= nestedList.length <= 50
The values of the integers in the nested list is in the range [-100, 100].
The maximum depth of any integer is less than or equal to 50.
