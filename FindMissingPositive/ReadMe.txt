Given an unsorted integer array nums, find the smallest missing positive integer.

Follow up: Could you implement an algorithm that runs in O(n) time and uses constant extra space.?

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,0]
Output: 3
Example 2:

Input: nums = [3,4,-1,1]
Output: 2
Example 3:

Input: nums = [7,8,9,11,12]
Output: 1
 

Constraints:

0 <= nums.length <= 300
-231 <= nums[i] <= 231 - 1
