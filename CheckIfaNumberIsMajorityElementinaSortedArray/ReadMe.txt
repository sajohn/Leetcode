Given an array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, and a number target, return True if and only if target is a majority element.

A majority element is an element that appears more than N/2 times in an array of length N.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [2,4,5,5,5,5,5,6,6], target = 5
Output: true
Explanation: 
The value 5 appears 5 times and the length of the array is 9.
Thus, 5 is a majority element because 5 > 9/2 is true.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [10,100,101,101], target = 101
Output: false
Explanation: 
The value 101 appears 2 times and the length of the array is 4.
Thus, 101 is not a majority element because 2 > 4/2 is false.
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 1000
1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9
1 <= target <= 10^9
