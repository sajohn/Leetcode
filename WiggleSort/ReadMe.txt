Given an integer array nums, reorder it such that nums[0] <= nums[1] >= nums[2] <= nums[3]....

You may assume the input array always has a valid answer.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,5,2,1,6,4]
Output: [3,5,1,6,2,4]
Explanation: [1,6,2,5,3,4] is also accepted.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [6,6,5,6,3,8]
Output: [6,6,5,6,3,8]
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 5 * 104
0 <= nums[i] <= 104
It is guaranteed that there will be an answer for the given input nums.
 

Follow up: Could you do it without sorting the array?
